# Day 2 — Forms & Validation

**Goal / Yool:** Practice HTML5 form input types and native validation.

**Tasks / Hawsha:**
- Open `index.html` and try submitting empty form — see browser validation.
- Change `minlength`, add `pattern` to email or password.
- Connect to console: (no JS required) — later integrate with React/Node.
